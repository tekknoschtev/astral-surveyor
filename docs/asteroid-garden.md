Summary: Asteroid Gardens Implementation Complete! ðŸŒŸ

I've successfully implemented the complete Asteroid Gardens system for Astral Surveyor! Here's what was accomplished:

âœ… Complete Feature Implementation

ðŸª¨ Asteroid Garden System Features:
- 5 Garden Types: Metallic, Crystalline, Carbonaceous, Icy, and Rare Minerals
- Glittering Starlight Effects: Dynamic sparkles and reflections that catch starlight
- Procedural Rock Generation: 3 rock shapes (round, angular, irregular) with clustered distributions
- Realistic Discovery: Distance-based discovery system with appropriate ranges
- Visual Variety: Different colors, sizes, and glitter intensities per garden type
- Rarity-Based Distribution: Balanced spawn rates (Metallic 35%, Carbonaceous 25%, Crystalline 20%, Icy 15%, Rare Minerals 5%)

ðŸŽ¨ Visual Effects:
- Multi-layered Rendering: Asteroids render between nebulae and stars for proper depth
- Dynamic Glitter: Time-based sparkle animation with garden-type specific intensities
- Rock Animation: Subtle rotation and glitter phases for living feel
- Discovery Indicators: Golden dashed circles when discovered
- Particle Optimization: Off-screen culling and LOD for performance

ðŸ”§ Technical Integration:
- Chunk System Integration: Full compatibility with infinite world generation
- Discovery System: Complete integration with game discovery mechanics and sound
- Type System: Proper TypeScript support with expanded CelestialObject types
- World Generation: Smart placement avoiding star systems with retry logic
- Save/Load Support: Discovery data serialization and persistence

ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Test Coverage: 29 Tests Passing

- AsteroidGarden Class Tests: Initialization, ID generation, discovery distance
- Garden Type Tests: Structure validation, rarity distribution, discovery values
- Procedural Generation: Consistency, rock properties, visual effects
- Discovery Logic: Range-based discovery, re-discovery prevention
- Rendering System: On/off-screen handling, discovery indicators, rock shapes
- Visual Effects: Color palettes, glitter effects, garden-specific behaviors
- World Integration: Chunk compatibility, serialization
- Type Selection: Weighted distribution, fallback handling
- Edge Cases: Small/large fields, extreme coordinates, performance

ðŸŽ® Game Integration Complete

- Discovery Sounds: Asteroid garden discoveries play appropriate audio
- Rare Discovery Detection: Crystalline, Icy, and Rare Mineral gardens trigger special sounds
- UI Integration: Proper discovery names and types in discovery display and logbook
- Rendering Pipeline: Asteroid gardens render in correct layer order

ðŸŒŒ Design Philosophy Maintained

- Tranquil Exploration: Sparse distribution (85% of chunks have no asteroids) creates anticipation
- Wonder and Discovery: Beautiful glittering effects that reward exploration
- Emergent Patterns: Players can learn to recognize different garden types
- Non-violent: Pure beauty and curiosity-driven discovery

The Asteroid Gardens add a perfect new layer to Astral Surveyor's exploration experience - scattered fields of glittering rocks that catch starlight create moments of breathtaking beauty as players discover these cosmic       
gems floating in the void. Each garden type offers unique visual characteristics and discovery rewards, encouraging continued exploration while maintaining the game's peaceful, contemplative atmosphere.
