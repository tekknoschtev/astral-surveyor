# Black Holes üï≥Ô∏è

Black holes in Astral Surveyor will be extremely rare celestial objects, appearing in only a tiny fraction of star systems. Their immense gravitational pull will be reflected in the game's physics, affecting the player's ship movement when they get close. They won't have planets orbiting them, and their presence will prevent any other celestial objects from spawning within their radius.

## Key Mechanics & Rules
- [ ] **Discovery:** Black holes, like stars, will be discoverable from a great distance (e.g., 500+ pixels), allowing players to navigate towards them safely.
- [ ] **Appearance:** A black hole will appear as a massive, dark sphere, surrounded by a bright, swirling accretion disk or corona of light at its edge. This visual effect will be dynamic, showcasing the bending of light and spacetime around the object. The interior will be a completely black void that extends for many chunks, with a very small bright point of light, the singularity, at its absolute center.
- [ ] **Safety Warning:** As a player approaches the event horizon (the edge of the black hole's visual corona), a prominent, non-obtrusive warning will appear on the screen. This warning, perhaps a message like "Warning: Uncharted Gravity Well - Unknown Effects Beyond This Point," will inform the player of the potential consequences of entering the black hole.
- [ ] **Singularity Encounter:** The singularity is the final point of no return. Touching this point will trigger a unique game event. Instead of ending the game, it will reset the universe's procedural generation seed, creating an entirely new cosmos to explore. The player, however, will retain their discovery logbook and all previously cataloged celestial objects, ensuring that their progress isn't lost. This feature adds a sense of cosmic rebirth and provides a way for players to "start fresh" in a new universe while keeping their exploration history.

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] **Event Horizon:** After crossing the event horizon, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to escape the gravity of the black hole.  The only option for the player is to enter the singularity.
