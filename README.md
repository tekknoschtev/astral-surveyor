# Astral Surveyor
Astral Surveyor is a tranquil, 2D pixel-art space exploration game where you chart the vast unknown of a procedurally generated universe. Step into the role of a lone surveyor, drifting through star systems in search of undiscovered planets, stars, and celestial phenomena.

With no combat or time pressure, your mission is one of peaceful curiosity: catalog rare stellar formations, identify elements from planetary scans, and build your own star map of the cosmos. Navigate using a minimalist HUD and an expandable universe map, accompanied by ambient space music that ebbs and flows with your journey.

Whether you stumble upon a glowing blue quasar, a whispering cloud of interstellar dust, or a frozen planet with crystalline terrain, every discovery is a moment of wonder.
