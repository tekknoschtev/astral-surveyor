# Astral Surveyor
*A tranquil space exploration game of infinite wonder*

Astral Surveyor is a peaceful, 2D space exploration game where you chart the vast unknown of a procedurally generated universe. Step into the role of a lone surveyor, drifting through star systems in search of undiscovered planets, stars, and celestial phenomena.

With no combat or time pressure, your mission is one of peaceful curiosity: catalog rare stellar formations, discover exotic worlds, track orbiting moons, and build your own comprehensive star chart of the cosmos. Navigate using intuitive controls and professional-grade astronomical tools, accompanied by the serene silence of deep space.

Whether you discover a pulsing neutron star, encounter a binary system with swirling energy patterns, or find a gas giant with four orbiting moons, every discovery is a moment of wonder that's yours to catalog and share.
